## 🚀 Method 1: Using PowerShell (Easiest)

### Step 1: Open PowerShell

**Windows 10/11**:
1. Click Start button (Windows logo)
2. Type: `powershell`
3. Click "Windows PowerShell"

You'll see a blue window with text!

### Step 2: Connect to Your Server

Copy this command and paste it in PowerShell:

```powershell
ssh root@24.199.116.165
```

**Press Enter**

### Step 3: Enter Password

You'll see: `root@24.199.116.165's password:`

**Type your password** (you won't see it - that's normal!)

**Press Enter**

✅ You're now connected to your server! You'll see something like:
```
root@easyfix-restaurant:~#
```

---

## 🎯 The Magic Command

### Step 4: Install Everything Automatically

Copy and paste this ONE command:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alhajjmuhammed/Easy-Fix-Restaurant/main/deploy.sh -o deploy.sh && chmod +x deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

**Press Enter**

**What happens now?**
- The script downloads
- Installs Python, Database, Web Server
- Downloads your restaurant project
- Sets up everything automatically
- Takes about 10-15 minutes

☕ **Grab a coffee!** Wait for it to finish.

You'll see lots of text scrolling. That's normal! 

### Step 5: Look for Success Message

When done, you'll see:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                          ║

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Congratulations!** 🎉 Your website is installed!

## 👤 Create Your Admin Account

## 🔍 Quick Check: Is Everything Working?

### Check 1: Services Running

In PowerShell (still connected to server), type:

```bash
sudo systemctl status restaurant
```

Look for: **"active (running)"** in green ✅

If you see red ❌, type:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart restaurant
```

### Check 2: Can You Access Website?

In browser: `http://24.199.116.165`

✅ Can see website = SUCCESS!  
❌ Can't see website = See troubleshooting below

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Problem 1: "Connection refused" when connecting to server

**Solution**: 
- Check your password (DigitalOcean sent it via email)
- Make sure you copied the command correctly
- Try again: `ssh root@24.199.116.165`

### Problem 2: Script fails or shows errors

**Solution**: Try manual installation steps from DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

Or run these commands one by one:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl git
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alhajjmuhammed/Easy-Fix-Restaurant/main/deploy.sh -o deploy.sh
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Problem 3: Website shows "502 Bad Gateway"

**Solution**: Restart services
```bash
sudo systemctl restart restaurant
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Wait 30 seconds, then refresh browser.

### Problem 4: No CSS (website looks broken)

**Solution**: Collect static files
```bash
cd /var/www/restaurant
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
sudo systemctl restart restaurant
```

### Problem 5: "Permission denied" errors

**Solution**: Fix permissions
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/restaurant
sudo systemctl restart restaurant
```
