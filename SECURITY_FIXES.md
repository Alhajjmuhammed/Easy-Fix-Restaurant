# Security & Data Consistency Fixes - October 7, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy Warning ✅
**Problem:** Browser warning about untrusted origin and missing CORS headers
**Solution:** 
- Added proper security headers middleware
- Enabled CSRF protection for security
- Added Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
- Added Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
- Added X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- Added X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Added Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 2. Data Consistency Issues ✅
**Problem:** 9 orphaned users without proper owner relationships
**Found:**
- 26 total users with 6 owners
- 9 orphaned users (customers and staff without restaurant owners)
- Users: alhajjmuhamme, b, customercare1, customercare2, testcustomer, customer_care, customer_car, ss, test_universal_customer

**Solution:**
- Created data cleanup management command
- Assigned all orphaned users to 'tropican' restaurant owner
- Result: 0 orphaned users, 19 users properly linked to owners

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **restaurant_system/settings.py**
   - Re-enabled CSRF middleware for security
   - Added security headers configuration
   - Added custom SecurityHeadersMiddleware class
   - Added CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS for development
   - Added session security settings

2. **accounts/management/commands/cleanup_data.py** (NEW)
   - Django management command for data cleanup
   - Identifies orphaned users and inconsistencies
   - Options: --dry-run, --delete-orphaned, --assign-default-owner
   - Comprehensive reporting and transaction safety

3. **test_security.py** (NEW)
   - Script to verify security headers are working
   - Tests CORS policies and security configurations

## Security Headers Verified:
- ✅ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
- ✅ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp  
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Database Status After Fixes:
- Total users: 26
- Owners: 6
- Users with owners: 19
- Orphaned users: 0

## Usage Commands:
```bash
# Check for data issues
python manage.py cleanup_data --dry-run

# Assign orphaned users to an owner
python manage.py cleanup_data --assign-default-owner <owner_username>

# Delete orphaned users (use with caution)
python manage.py cleanup_data --delete-orphaned

# Test security headers
python test_security.py
```

## Impact:
- ✅ Resolved Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy browser warnings
- ✅ Fixed all orphaned user data consistency issues
- ✅ Improved security with proper headers
- ✅ Added monitoring tools for future data integrity
- ✅ Enhanced CSRF protection while maintaining functionality

The system is now secure and data-consistent with no orphaned records.
